## Example of output
```
// week #1 directory
In graph of SCC_small, the sizes of the five largest SCCs is:
6,3,2,1

// week #2 directory
In graph of djData.txt, the shortest-path distances from 1 to 7,37,59,82,99,115,133,165,188,197 is: 
2599,2610,2947,2052,2367,2399,2029,2442,2505,3068
```

## Design of the code
1. Read the data from txt file using fs;
2. formating data;
3. using specific algorisms to finish problem;

## How to run it
1. install node.js
2. cd to the specific directory, read the README.md file
3. using `node [filename]`to run the js file
